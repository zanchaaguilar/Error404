	 		 <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
	 	    <p><h3>Payment Options</h3> <br>
<h4>1. Online Card Payments</h4><br>
Visa, Master and American Express Card payments are processed through an online payment gateway system. You need not worry about your 
card information falling into the wrong hands because your bank will authorize the card transaction directly without any information passing
 through us. In approximately 25-30 seconds (depending on your internet connection) your bank will issue, using the online payment gateway,
 an authorization code and confirmation of completion of transaction.
<br><br>	
Star Bus, as a Verisign Certified Site, uses the latest 128 bit encryption technology and other sophisticated methods to protect your credit card
 information. You can book your product using SSL encryption (the internet standard for secure transactions). In fact, transacting online with
 a credit card at the website is even safer than using a credit card at a restaurant because we do not retain your credit card information. 
You can be assured that Star Bus offers you the highest standards of security currently available on the internet so as to ensure that your 
shopping experience is private, safe and secure.
<br>
If the payment on the credit card is declined for some reason, alternate payment instructions must be received by Star Bus 72 hours prior to 
the time of departure; else, the order is liable to be cancelled.
<br><br>
Star Bus charges a service fee on all Bus bookings. In case of cancellation of booking, this fee is non-refundable.
<br><br>
<h4>Transaction Confirmation</h4>
<br>
You should not take any action based on information on the Website until you have received a confirmation of your transaction. In case of
 confirmations to be received by email, if you do not receive a confirmation of your purchase/transaction within the stipulated time period, 
first look into your "spam" or "junk" folder to verify that it has not been misdirected, and if still not found, please contact our call centre.
<br>
<h4>Delivery of Products/Services</h4>
<br>
<h4>What is an e-ticket? </h4><br>
An e-ticket (electronic ticket) is a paperless electronic document with a unique confirmation number given to passengers in place of a paper 
ticket. Passengers are required to produce the unique confirmation number at the airport airline counter to claim the e-ticket.
<br><br>
How will I get my e-ticket details?<br>
<br>Your e-ticket details will be sent to the email address provided by you at the time of booking. If you do not receive your e-ticket within 8 
hours of making your booking with Star Bus.com, please call our Customer Care Representative on 955 5800 800.
<br>
Star Bus Online Pvt. Ltd. shall not be liable if customers do not comply with this requirement.
<br><br>
Is it necessary to carry my e-ticket with me?<br>
<br>Yes, it is mandatory for you to carry a copy of your e-ticket as sent by Star Bus.com. In the event that you fail to present a copy of your 
e-ticket, Star Bus Online Pvt. Ltd. will not be held responsible if the Airline does not issue a boarding pass/ disallows you from travelling.
<br><br>
How will I get my boarding pass for an e-Ticket?<br>
<br>You need to show your e-ticket confirmation email and e-ticket along with a photo identity proof (passport, driver's license etc.) at the 
airline check-in counter. Thereafter the airline representative will issue your boarding pass.
<br><br>
Prepaid Ticket Advice ("PTA")<br>
<br>A PTA is a Prepaid Ticket Advice. We will give you a PTA number that you need to present at the airport check-in counter of the airline. 
<br>The airline representative will print and give you your ticket at that time.
<br>

<br>Refund Policy
<br>The refund accruing to the Star Bus Customer shall be processed within 15-20 working days from the date of the cancellation request 
and subject to receipt of the refunds from the service provider or Airline. If we have received the payment through a valid credit card, then
 the same will be refunded to your credit card. Payments made using any other form of payment will be refunded by cheque within a 
maximum of 30 days from date of cancellation of ticket. All refunds shall be processed subject to processing of refunds by the respective 
airline/service provider.

<br>Star Bus acts only as a facilitator of services and shall not be held liable for any changes, deficiencies, disputes, etc. related to the 
services being provided by the third party service providers, including the matters related to delays in refunds or no refunds, of the fares and 
charges paid to third party service providers.

<br>Please note convenience fee charged at the time of booking will not be refundable.
<br>

<br>Star Bus.com reserves the right to add, alter, modify, withdraw all or any of the Terms and Conditions or replace, wholly or in part,
